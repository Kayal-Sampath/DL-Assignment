# DL-Assignment
Implement any 3 ML algorithms and compare their performance using KfoldXV method. 

1. Choose any 3 ML algorithms and give a brief description for each algorithm.

2. Explain the chosen dataset and the analysis to be performed based on the dataset.

3. Implementation (Attach the complete code of the algorithms)

4. Performance metric/s and the comparison table (60:40, 70:30, 80:20, 90:10)

5. Inference and conclusion
